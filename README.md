# Jetson Robotic Arm

Curious where to start? Well, you've made it to the right place. Install the required software and packages in the steps below before moving on to programming your robot. 

## 1. Download the Required Software  
Using the software center, you will need to install the software below. If you have previously installed any of these without the Software Center installer, you will need to uninstall and then re-install. 
  - Python
  - VSCode
  - xArm  

## 2. Install Some Python Libraries  
To install some initial external packages within VS Code, open up the terminal (CTRL + `) and enter the following command:  
  
<code>pip install xarm hidapi mediapipe opencv-python numpy </code>
  
> NOTE: If you are using multiple Python versions or virtual environments, and pip install ... does not work, use py -m pip install ... instead.

Now you're ready. [Move on to coding](https://github.com/mrrilett/Jetson/blob/main/GetCoding.md)
